Episode-Picker
==============

A script made to be run inside a directory with folders going to different seasons of a series. When run in this way it will pick a random season, then a random episode from that season, and then play that episode in VLC. This script is expected to only really be used by me so not much effort has been put into documentation. I am thinking about rewriting it to Python at some stage and increase the user friendlyness.
